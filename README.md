### Web-Scraping

This project utilizes Splinter, Beautiful Soup, and Pandas to scrape data from websites that contain data about Mars.  I scraped data from the following websites:
1) Nasa Mars News Site - for Mars news
2) Jet Propulsion Laboratory website - for featured images
3) Mars Weather Twitter - for Mars weather
4) Space Facts - for facts about Mars
5) USGS Astrogeology Site - for Mars hemisphere images

After scraping, using Python, I save the scraped data to MongoDB and create a webpage that displays the data that I scraped using Flask.
